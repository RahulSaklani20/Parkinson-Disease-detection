Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, causing 
significant challenges to both patients and healthcare systems. Characterized by the progressive loss of 
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain, PD manifests with a variety of motor and non
motor symptoms, including tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. 
The early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is crucial for timely intervention and effective 
management of the condition. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on clinical assessments, which may not 
be sufficiently sensitive or specific, leading to potential misdiagnoses. As the field of medical research continues 
to embrace technological advancements, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing 
the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis. 
This research endeavours to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease 
based on a curated dataset. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of clinical and demographic features, offering 
a rich source of information for training and evaluating predictive models. By harnessing the power of ML 
algorithms, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that can aid in the early identification of Parkinson's 
disease, paving the way for more targeted and personalized medical interventions. 
The use of machine learning in medical diagnostics has shown remarkable success in various domains, and its 
application to Parkinson's disease detection holds the potential to revolutionize how we approach diagnosis and 
treatment. This paper presents an in-depth exploration of the dataset, the methodology employed in model 
development, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the predictive performance. Additionally, we discuss the 
implications of our findings for the broader landscape of Parkinson's disease research and healthcare.
